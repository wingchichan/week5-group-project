PLANNING INFORMATION:

Design and Planning
    After agreeing on the idea of a job application tracker, we started working on the wireframe. We used Figma for the wireframe and we used Trello
    to visualise the tasks and manage who is doing each tasks. We then allocated tasks to each person, for instance Taran and Wing were to focus on the 
    database, backend and the javascript on the front end, whereas Maria and Wahid would focus mainly on the HTML, CSS and some DOM manipulation.

Database Integration
    We started off by creating the database for the job applications using Supabase. We then inserted some dummy data into the database, and got the 
    codes we would need for the database connection. After this, we shared the environment varibales on our google meet chat.

Back-End Development
    We then built the server, where we imported the necessary node packages, and then we created a postgres to link the database. After this we created 
    the GET, POST, DELETE and PUT functions for the app using express, and then started the server.

Front-End Development
    Next, we created a semantic base with the sections/elements needed in HTML, and linked the files together.
    We then sorted out our main.js with the functions needed to fetch the data from the server, display it, and manipulate the HTML and CSS using DOM manipulation.
    Then we added some extra fetaures/functions to clean the data, to add extra styling/animations, and a homepage.

INSTRUCTIONS:

On loading the page, the user comes to a Homepage. There, they would navigate
to the dashboard.
(Clicking the logo in the top left naviagtes back and forth from the homepage to the dashboard. If we had more time, we would have ensured the hompeage is loaded first, for now the dashboard loads first.)

The user should be able to see their previous applications on the right, and a form to submit a new one to the left.

The user can sumbit a new appliction by filling in the form, and clicking add application. Also the user could edit a previous application by clicking the edit button, or delete a previous application by pressing the delete button.
